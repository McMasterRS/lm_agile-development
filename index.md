As software projects became more complex, several software methodologies were devised to help developers get their projects across the finish line and create high-quality software that meets the users' expectations. The Agile methodology is one such technique that quickly gained popularity in the modern workplace given its proven ability to accelerate software delivery, increase productivity and enhance the overall software quality. By emphasizing constant communication between the users (stakeholders) and the developers, Agile's iterative approach to software development ensures that a software product can meet the users' changing requirements. In this learning module, we will learn how to leverage the power of Agile to organize the development process of your software project. We will start off by defining the Agile methodology and going over its principles to demonstrate the advantages that it presents over traditional methodologies like the Waterfall methodology. We will then learn how to organize your software project according to the Agile principles using GitHub Projects and Microsoft Planner. 

## Prerequisites
- **GitHub Account:** We will be using GitHub Projects to create a task-board for our demo software project. You will need to have access to your own GitHub account as well as a GitHub repository.
- **Microsoft Planner Account:** We will also be using Microsoft Planner as an example of another tool that you can use to organize your project according to the Agile principles.
